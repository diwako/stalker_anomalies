# Stalker like anomalies for Arma 3

This is a small side project of mine to create some anomalies like they are found in the STALKER game series. I started working on this as I noticed a lack of available addons or mods that offer anomalies, like they are found in the zone.

If you like this idea and want to contribute, just do a pull request.
If you want to use this in a mission, sure go ahead, but please write me in the credits.

This project is aiming to be compatible with addons CBA and ACE. It works in single and multiplayer. The mod tries to use as much content as vanilla offers, so this project can be implemented on a per mission basis and does not need any addons (besides CBA).

Additionally, some items have been added and this mod uses the CBA settings framwork.
