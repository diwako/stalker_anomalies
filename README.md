# STALKER-like Anomalies for Arma 3

This is a small side project aimed at recreating anomalies similar to those found in the STALKER game series. Development started after noticing a lack of available addons or mods that provide Zone-like anomalies for Arma 3.

If you like the idea and want to contribute, feel free to open a pull request.  
If you want to use this mod in a mission, go right ahead.

This project is designed to be compatible with CBA and ACE. It works in both singleplayer and multiplayer environments. The mod intentionally relies as much as possible on vanilla Arma content, allowing it to be used on a per-mission basis without requiring additional addons beyond CBA.

In addition, several custom items are included, and the mod makes extensive use of the CBA settings framework.
