# Editing Anomaly Detector

The detector is an item carried in the player’s inventory. By default, this item uses the class `AnomalyDetector`.

You can change which item is used as the detector in the mod’s CBA Settings menu, also known as Addon Options. This allows you to assign a more thematically fitting item if desired.

When enabled, the detector begins beeping whenever it detects an anomaly within range. The beeping frequency increases as you get closer to the anomaly. The detector always prioritizes the closest anomaly when determining the beep rate.

Depending on the mission settings, the detector may stop beeping entirely if there is _no active_ anomaly within range.

## Using the Detector

The detector can be activated in several ways, provided it is present in the player’s inventory.

### Without ACE

You can enable or disable the detector using the action menu, also known as the "scroll wheel menu".

### With ACE

Using ACE’s interaction menu, self-interact, navigate to `Equipment`, and locate the detector. From there, you can enable or disable it.

### With either

It is also possible to interact with the detector by double-clicking its icon directly in the inventory. This method provides additional options, including enabling or disabling the detector and adjusting its volume.
