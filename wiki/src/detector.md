# Editing Anomaly Detector

The detector is an item in the player's inventory. By default, this item is of class `AnomalyDetector`.

However, you can change the item designated as detector in the mod's CBA setting's Menu (also known as Addon Options), in case you have a more fitting item for the job.

The detector starts beeping whenever it is enabled and detects an anomaly within range. It starts to beep faster the closer you get. It will always prioritize the closest anomaly for the beeping!

Depending on the mission settings, it stops beeping if there is _no active_ anomaly in range.

## Using the detector

The detector can be activated through several means when having the detector in your inventory.

### Without ACE

You can enable and disable the detector using the action menu, also known as the "scroll wheel menu".

### With ACE

Using ACE's interaction menu, you can self-interact, go to `Equipment` and there you see the detector. Here you can enable or disable it.

### With either

It is possible to interact with the detector by double clicking the item icon right inside your inventory. There you have even more options. \
The regular enable and disable option, but also to turn the volume of the detector up and down!
