# Bolts

Bolts are used to trigger anomalies by throwing them into the affected area, or, if you are feeling mischievous, at your friends for fun.

Make sure to aim at the ground where the anomaly is located. If the bolt passes through the anomaly at a higher altitude, it may not trigger, resulting in a wasted bolt. Once thrown, bolts cannot be picked up again.

There are two bolt-related items included in the mod: a bag of bolts and a single bolt.

While the bag of bolts is described as having an infinite supply, it actually contains a finite amount of 9999 bolts.

In Arma terms, bolts are implemented as grenades. However, they do not explode when used. When thrown, the mod attaches an invisible balloon to the grenade, which is what activates the anomaly. Contrary to popular belief, the grenade itself has no effect, which is why other grenade types cannot be used to trigger anomalies.
