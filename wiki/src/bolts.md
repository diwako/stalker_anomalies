# Bolts

Bolts are used to be thrown into an anomaly to activate it, or to throw them in your friends’ face for the fun of it.

Make sure to aim at the floor the anomaly resides on, sometimes when the bolt flies through the anomaly, you might have thrown it too high and nothing will happen, except wasting a bolt. And no, you cannot pick it up again.

There are two bolt items in the mod. One bag full of bolts, and a single bolt.

While the bag of bolts is said to have infinite bolts to spare, it actually has a limited number of just 9999 bolts.

The bolts are in the Arma sense just grenades, upon using them they do not explode, however. When thrown, the mod will attach an invisible balloon to the grenade, which activates the anomaly. Contrary to popular belief the grenade itself does nothing, hence why does no other grenade work for activating anomalies.
