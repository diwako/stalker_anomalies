# Diwako's STALKER-like anomalies rework
This is the knowledge hub of the *Diwako's STALKER-like anomalies rework* mod for ARMA 3. The mod is fully open source and happily accepts contributions.

Features and modules are described in appropriate pages.  

# Requirements
The latest version of [CBA](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3).

[ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3) is fully supported, but not needed.\
[ZEN](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1779063631) is highly recommended if you are zeusing, but not needed if you just use the 3den editor. When using ZEN you can spawn the anomalies from the zeus UI.

# Releases
The latest official release is available from the [STEAM WORKSHOP](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3351980695).
