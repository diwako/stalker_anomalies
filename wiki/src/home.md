Features and modules are documented on their respective pages.

# Requirements

The latest version of [CBA](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3).

[ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3) is fully supported but not required.  
[ZEN](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1779063631) is highly recommended if you are using Zeus, but it is not required when working exclusively in the 3DEN Editor. When using ZEN, anomalies can be spawned directly from the Zeus interface.

# Releases

The latest official release is available on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3351980695).
